<h1> Introduction </h1>
   
**A program i am creating with LuaRT that is installed on a USB or an External Hard Drive, It can run wii emulators such as: Dolphin &amp; Cemu. Making these 2 programs portable, managable, accessable & easy to use on any Windows PC!**

**( ! ) NOTE: This is a working inprogress project & soon i'll be releasing the first beta release of the program. I respect the emulator's FAQ Rules & their policies, im not responsible for any problem you have caused or any rules you have broken with the emulators and this includes on: data loss, broken system or game, malfunction, bad management, or any other critical issues you haved caused with the emulators.**

<h1> What can Virtual Wii Manager do? </h1>

- **It can load Dolphin Emulator's contents into the PC and after finishing using the emulator on the PC the contents are retrieved back to Virtual Wii's Drive automatically.**
- **Games can be easily installed into Virtual Wii's Drive.**
- **You can easily import, export, download & install contents from the emulators' folder.**
- **It can backup dolphin's & cemu's emulator folder & it's contents such as: Firmware (NAND), configurations, contents, etc.. every time when its loaded into the PC <-- (This feature will be enabled by default in the settings.)**
- **PC Specs Detect system: This is a special system that detects the PC's components such as: RAM, CPU & GPU so a perfect match of settings file can be used on the emulators for better experience & performance when running the emulators in the PC. <-- (Feature Work inprogress)**
- **Custom Contents & App Plugins for the program. <-- (Feature Work inprogress)**
